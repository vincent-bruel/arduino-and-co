## Projects involving Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32:
	1. Control a dust collector with magnetic sensors on blast gates
	```

```

	2. Highlight a photo frame with backlight, led pointing at locations and LCD screen displaying location names

   Take a look at my Youtube Channel, there will be Videos for some of these projects.

   I will maintain a list here when they become available:
   
## These projects use my own libraries that are stored in CommonLibraries subdirectory.

## These projects use some third party libraries for which I will maintain a list here.
