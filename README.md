## Projects involving Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32:
	1. Control a dust collector with magnetic sensors on blast gates
	![Dust Collector Commander](https://github.com/vincent-bruel/arduino-and-co/tree/master/Projects/DustCollectorCommander-ArduinoNano-HallSensorsA3144)
	2. Highlight a photo frame with backlight, led pointing at locations and LCD screen displaying location names
	![Luminous photo frame](https://github.com/vincent-bruel/arduino-and-co/tree/master/Projects/LuminousPhotoFrame-Leonardo-74HC795-2x16LCDSerial)
	3. Display weather forecast with an ESP32 and 4x8x8 dot matrix led

   Take a look at my Youtube Channel, there will be Videos for some of these projects.

   I will maintain a list here when they become available:
   
## These projects use my own libraries that are stored in CommonLibraries subdirectory.

## These projects use some third party libraries for which I will maintain a list here.
