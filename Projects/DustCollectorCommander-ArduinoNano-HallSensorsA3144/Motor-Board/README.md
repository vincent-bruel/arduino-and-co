## Wiring Schema

## Pseudo Algorithm for moving the mobile hole linear

1. If motor is not moving and no hall sensor is activated => ERROR
Because we always stop the motor in front of a hole position, so the magnet is always in front of a hall sensor.
2. Current hole number = Current hall sensor activated.
3. Wait for 4-way-selector to be moved (ie different value than the actual one), when operator wants to select another hole/dust line. This gives us a Desired hole number
4. If Desired hole number > Current hole number move motor Counter-Wise
5. If Desired hole number < Current hole number move motor Counter-Clock-Wise
6. Stop motor when a different hall sensor is activated
7. Goto 2.

This pseudo code is implemented in the Arduino code (.ino).
Note that this is not yet a production code, just a proof-of-concept for now, because the hardare
is in development.
So the .ino is subject to change.
So the Wiring Schema is subject to change

## Components used
1. DC 12V wiper motor
2. VNH2SP30 1 motor controler, high current
3. Arduino Nano (or Uno), at least a 5V Arduino.


## Truth table to control the motor:

Action | Pin states
-------|-----------
STOP   | D7 0, D8 0 & D7 1, D7 1
CCW    | D7 0, D8 1 
CW     | D7 1, D8 0
