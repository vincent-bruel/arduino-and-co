## Subject: Control a dust collector (Jet DC110A-M 230V 1.5HP) via magnetic sensors on blast gates and/or with manual switches
Note that the relay controled by the Arduino Nano does not control directly the dust collector: it controls a power Contacter that controls the dust collector power.
You can use regular ethernet cables (with or without rj45 connectors) to plug sensors and switches to the PCB hosting the Arduino and the relay.

The magnetic detection is made with hall sensors (cheap A3144).

WARNING: do not attempt to wire/solder anything unless you have the required skills to do it: this project
requires 230V wiring, that can be dangerous and cause serious injury/death/...

## Logical Architecture
This schema shows the logical architecture.
The dust collector has two crosses on it since only the blower part is used: the vortex, the bags, and the mobile cart on wheels are not used.
In the future, the "Mobile hole board" movement will be motorized:
1. "Mobile hole board" movement will be bound to the blast gate detector to select the main dust collection line when activated: currently I have to manually move the "mobile hole board" in front of the main line hole.
2. The manual switch, which is now used to turn the dust collector on manually for the non-main-line dust producers
will be replaced by an analog potentiometer (or a rotary encoder) to select which line to align with the "mobile hole board".

## Electrical diagram for the Arduino Dust controler
In this diagram, only one Hall Sensor and only one manual switch are drawn to stay clear.
But you can add as many as there are Numerical/Analogical PIN on the Arduino you choose.
All black wires are connected together (and here to the Arduino GND pin) in this type of protoboard.
All red wires are connected together (and here to the Arduino 5V pin) in this type of protoboard.

## You will need Arduino IDE to program arduino nano via USB.
